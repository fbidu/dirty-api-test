# Quick 'n' Dirty API Tester

This gotta be the simplest and easiest API tester in the market.
Quite simply, you just add a bunch of APIs' addresses and some endpoints in the `config.yaml` file. The program will then loop through all of them, try to connect to them, check if the endpoint returned an HTTP-200. If anything goes wrong, it shoots an email.
Very useful to use with a `cron` job to test periodically.
Unfortunately, it is not use-ready just yet. The whole email sending thing is non functional as I'm using an internal API of mine to do the job. I'll allow for SMTP soon.

## Installing
1. Git clone the repo
2. `cd` into the folder
3. Start a virtual environment with Python 3.4. `virtualenv -p python3.4 venv`
4. Activate the env `source \folder-you-cloned-the-repo\venv\bin\activate`
5. Install the requirements `pip -r requirements.txt`
6. Copy the `config.sample.yaml` file to `config.yaml`
7. Edit the `config.yaml` file for your needs

## Usage
Well you can just run the code manually. Being with the virtualenvironment set just run `python qndapi.py`
You can also set up a cron job. Keep in mind that you'll **have to reference to the Python binary inside the virtual environment!**
Your cron command should be something like: `/path-to-qndapi/venv/bin/python /path-to-qndapi/qndapi.py`
